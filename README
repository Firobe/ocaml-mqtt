Message parser for MQTT written in OCaml.

This library is really only useful for message parsing.
While there is a simple client and server example, the
semantics of the MQTT protocol are not implemented.

MQTT version 3.1 messages are supported, but not the
3.1.1 'update', which is incompatible in several ways.
